#CONCEPT

This app is a to do list aimed at people with mental illnesses, focused on depression. Simple to do lists aren't enough when the user can't get themselves motivated. The lists will be ordered by level of difficulty, energy level required, due dates, and importance.

The homepage of the app will ask "How are you feeling today?" and list three options: good, okay, and bad **may update in future** This will take you to an index page that will show the user things they need to do today, in the next week, and in the next month. They can also organize their to-do lists by level of difficulty specific to them, and order of importance. There will be a fixed nav bar on the bottom that has a Daily To Do, Suggestions for what to do when you don't know what to do, and an Emergency page that has an ICE contact, favorite websites, and a link to Google.

The show page for each task will be further broken down into steps that make it easier to conceptualize how to get the task done - these will be reorder-able for user preference. On the right will be a difficulty level, energy level, due date, reward option, and completed or not completed. At the bottom will be a link to Need Help Getting Started? with suggestions as to how to get started on a task. This may be a direct link to Google that looks for "How do I get started #{name.task}?"

There will also be custom lists the user can build and come back to, like things to do when they're having an off day, a custom list of favorite things to do, and a custom list of rewards.
